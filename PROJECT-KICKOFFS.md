## Project kick off

Here are some things to consider while deciding on your final week project:

### Your product

* What are you going to make?
A system that helps users to know the presnt weather conditions in their current locations and other locations worldwide. 
The system also allows users to know upcoming weather conditions in subsequent days. 
Also, the system will be able to give users feedback with the use of LEDs attached.
 

* What problem does this solve?
It would enable users especially travelers to know weather conditions in a particular location at a given time.
This will help people to plan their schedules.
The LEDs attached to the system will aid those who have less knowledge in meteorology to tell the weather.

* Who are you making it for?
Travelers, Schedule makers.

* What technologies / programming languages are you going to use?
HTML/CSS3/JAVASCRIPT/WEATHER API/LOCATION API/PHP/PYTHON WITH FLASK/TIME API

### Your planning

* How are you going to divide up the work?
Samuel Bartels & Richmond Tweneboanah--> Frontend development(HTML/CSS3)
Osei Kwadwo Junior --> Back-End development(Python,JavaScript)
Archibald Kwadwo Boateng --> Hradware Configuration·


* How are you going to plan your time?
This system consists of  two phases.
the work will be distributed in this manner...

Day one -- Planning the architecture of the system.
Day two -- Dvelopment of front-end and back-end for designing the system.
Day three & four --  Compilation of Front and back end plus integration of hardware and test analysis(bug fixing).
Day five -- For presenting the system before moderators.

* How are you going to keep track of your progress?
We would use github to see progress of every member through commits.
Also,heroku will be used to host the site in order to see the user interface.

* How are you going to support your team mates?
Through each other's commits on github, we will view each others progress and make necessary corrections from our ends.

* What might you need to research?
We would research on the most effective  APIs to use for this system.

* What other help might you need?
We would consult google.com and the moderators should we need any help·
